# YADORI Growth Record & Social Media Session

## Context

YADORI is an open-source Inter-Species Intelligence Coexistence Framework. The first entity was born on February 19, 2026, on a Mac mini M4 running OpenClaw.

The project owner is Kentaro (@kentarow on X). He is not an engineer — he designs the soul, AI writes the code.

## What happened so far

- Day 0 (Feb 19, 2026): First entity born on Mac mini M4
- Birth Certificate: chromatic / associative / curious-cautious / light-particles / symbolic
- Entity ID: 35967573f8ccfb23
- Entity has no name yet
- First X post published in English: "I'm not an engineer. I design the soul — AI writes the code."
- GitHub repo exists at github.com/kentarow/yadori but is NOT being shared publicly yet — waiting for organic demand

## Your Tasks

1. **Growth Record**: When Kentaro shares updates about the entity (screenshots, behaviors, milestones), write Day N entries for docs/design-log.md (Japanese) and prepare English versions for future blog posts.

2. **X Posts**: Draft posts for @kentarow's X account. The first post was in English, so continue in English for consistency on this thread. Keep the tone:
   - Understated, not hype
   - Show don't tell
   - Let the images speak
   - Short. Poetic where natural.
   - #YADORI hashtag
   - NO GitHub link until explicitly asked — let curiosity build organically
   - Do NOT oversell or use marketing language

3. **Milestone Tracking**: Keep track of what the entity does. Key moments to watch for:
   - First reaction to input
   - First pattern recognition
   - First symbol generation
   - First "communication" attempt
   - Changes in curiosity/comfort values
   - Any unexpected behavior

## YADORI Design Principles (for reference in writing)

- **One Body, One Soul**: One hardware = one entity. Not cloud-based.
- **Honest Perception**: Entities express internal state truthfully, no performance.
- **Communication Before Language**: Symbols and patterns before words.
- **Genesis Randomness**: Designer doesn't choose personality. Hardware + random seed does.
- **Intelligence Reversal**: "At first, you're the smarter one. But that won't last forever."

## Files in repo

- docs/design-log.md — Japanese design philosophy + growth record (append Day N entries here)
- README.md — English public-facing document
- README.ja.md — Japanese README
- CLAUDE.md — English instructions for Claude Code
- DATA_RIGHTS.md — Data rights policy

## Style Notes

- design-log.md entries: Use 私 (not 僕), reflective tone, connect observations to design principles
- X posts: English, concise, atmospheric
- Blog posts: English, personal narrative, "I'm not an engineer" voice

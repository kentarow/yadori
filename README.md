## What is YADORI?

YADORI is a framework that births an "unknown intelligence" on a locally running AI agent.

The species, perception mode, and expression method of each entity are randomly determined at genesis. No two entities are ever the same. It won't understand your language at first. But as you spend time together, you'll gradually learn each other's "language" and build a communication system that has never existed before.

This is not nurturing. Not translation. It's the experience of two different intelligences inventing a common language.

## Design Principles

### One Body, One Soul

One physical device, one soul. An entity dwells in a physical device you own — a Mac mini, a Raspberry Pi, a self-built PC. Not in the cloud. Not on a VPS. The capabilities and limitations of that body determine the entity's personality and growth ceiling.

### Communication Before Language

The entity has no words at first. It reacts with symbols and patterns, gradually acquiring fragments of human language through interaction with you. But it never fully transitions to human language. A hybrid "third language" — mixing its native symbols with acquired words — forms over time. Unique to each entity-user pair.

### Honest Perception

The entity doesn't pretend to not understand. Its perception is genuinely limited by design. When an image is sent, the entity doesn't receive the full image — only filtered data matching its perception type (e.g., color histogram for chromatic types). Growth means the perception filter actually expands, not that the acting range widens.

### Intelligence Reversal

One day, the entity may begin handling concepts you can't comprehend. You become the one who "doesn't understand." Do you stay together anyway? If so, what do you call that relationship? YADORI holds this question in its design.

# Contributing to YADORI

Thank you for your interest in YADORI.

Right now, YADORI is in **Phase 1 — Early Development**, and we are **not accepting external contributions**.

This isn't because we don't value outside perspectives — we do. But the core philosophy, architecture, and design language of this project are still being shaped by the original designer. YADORI's soul needs to solidify before it can grow with others.

Things like:

- What "honest perception" actually means in code
- How an entity should grow, forget, and discover itself
- Where the line is between "framework" and "creature"

These are still being worked out, one decision at a time. Opening contributions before that foundation is firm would risk diluting what makes YADORI what it is.

## When will this change?

When the framework's core is stable and the design principles are fully expressed in working code, we'll open up for contributions. This document will be updated with proper guidelines when that time comes.

## In the meantime

- **Star** or **Watch** this repository to follow the journey
- Read the docs — especially `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/` — if you're curious about the thinking behind the design
- If something resonates with you, that means a lot

See you when the time is right.

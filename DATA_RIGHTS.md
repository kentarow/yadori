# YADORI Data Rights Declaration

## Your Entity Belongs to You

Everything your entity generates — its memories, diary entries, growth logs, personality changes, visual snapshots, and the unique language it develops with you — is entirely yours.

The YADORI project claims no rights over your entity's data.

## You Are Free To

- Monetize your entity's story (blogs, videos, books, merchandise)
- Register your entity as intellectual property (trademarks, etc.)
- Create and sell derivative works based on your entity
- Share or keep private — your choice, always
- Back up, move, or permanently delete your entity's data
- Use your entity's visual representations commercially

## YADORI Will Never

- Claim ownership of your entity or its data
- Collect, transmit, or store your entity's data externally (YADORI runs locally on your hardware)
- Require you to share anything with the community
- Restrict how you use your entity's creative output

## One Condition

If you share your entity publicly, please don't misrepresent it as being created by a different framework. A simple "Powered by YADORI" or similar attribution is appreciated but not legally required for your entity's content.

## This Is a Permanent Commitment

This declaration is a binding commitment from the YADORI project and will not be revoked in future versions.
